# Custom Module for managing movies

## What does this module do

1. Creates a custom content entity name Movie with the fields **title** and **release date**
2. Create a taxonomy vocabulary named **Genre** with the following terms: Comedy, Drama, and Action.
3. Add a **genre** field to the movie entity that is a reference to the Genre vocabulary.
4. Add validation to the movie entityâ€™s add and edit forms so that the **release_date** field is required and that it cannot be in the future.
5. Expose a REST export for all the Movie entities.

        }
    ]

### Managing movies
All the CRUD action can be found in `/admin/content/movie`.

### Accessing movies REST export
The movies export is accessible from the path `/movies?_format=json`, only `json` format is enabled, so it can also be accessed using only`/movies` and `json` format will be used.

## Notes
1. The movie entity was generated using the drush command `drush gen entity:content`.
2. The release date validation was done by creating a new field constraint plugin, and adding it to the `release_date` field definition.
3. All javascript alterations were done in the library `custom_movies/movies.admin_form`.
